# Deep Research using Agentic AI
This project helps in deep research by analyzing the web and other resources to generate insights. This system uses LangChain, LangGraph, and Tavily for accurate and structured results. It automates the process of retrieving, synthesizing, and generating well-structured answers to complex queries. This system is optimized for autonomous web research, information synthesis, and report generation with minimal human intervention.

## Features
1. Multi-Agent architecture: The system has three AI agents that focus on retrieving information from the web, synthesizing the data, and generating structured answers.
2. Automated research: Uses Tavily to conduct real-time web searches.
3. Uses Mistral AI for innovative response generation.
4. State Management: Uses LangGraph for structured execution.
